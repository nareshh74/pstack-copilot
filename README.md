# pstack for copilot

a port of [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack) by
[poteto](https://x.com/poteto), rewritten to run on the github copilot
app. 47 skills, 23 playbooks, 23 principles, and 3 agents. MIT, same as upstream.

this is not a mirror. the cursor plugin manifest, the `/add-plugin` install path,
the event-triggered automations, and the graphite stacking layer are all gone.
copilot and azure devops equivalents took their place. see
[what changed](#what-changed-from-upstream).

there's a growing sense that ai writes too much slop code. i agree. i don't want to ship like a team of twenty slop artists. throughput without quality is not a goal i aspire to. if you want to go fast, go deep first.

**pstack is the answer.** it turns copilot into a real engineering team. the goal is not to maximize loc, in fact it's the opposite. pstack helps you write less, but higher quality code.

**pstack gives you fearless parallelism.** when you can go deep on one agent and trust it to write good, verifiable code, you can truly parallelize with confidence. start multiple agents up with `poteto-mode` and trust that they'll apply rigorous engineering principles to their work.

**copilot gives you the best of all worlds.** every frontier model has its strengths and weaknesses. use any model with pstack. in fact, many of my skills use multi-model workflows to take advantage of each model's unique strengths.

fork it. improve it. make it yours. PRs are welcome! 

## install

clone it anywhere and register the skills directory globally, so every repo you
open gets them:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nareshh74/pstack-copilot ~/.copilot/pstack
copilot skill add ~/.copilot/pstack/skills
```

then copy the three agents so `poteto`, `poteto-worker`, and `comment-sicko`
show up as spawnable subagents:

```bash
cp ~/.copilot/pstack/agents/*.agent.md ~/.copilot/agents/
```

confirm with `copilot skill list`; the pstack skills appear under
`Custom skills:`. `~/.copilot/agents/` needs no registration.

then turn the mode on by default **and** grant path trust for playbooks:

```bash
node ~/.copilot/pstack/scripts/install-always-on.mjs
```

that writes the always-on block, adds `~/.copilot` to `config.json`
`trustedFolders`, and installs a `pstack` wrapper that passes
`--add-dir ~/.copilot` so headless runs can read playbooks and model
overrides. see [always-on](#always-on) for what it does and how to take it
back out. the [setup guide](./docs/guide/01-setup.md) has the path-trust
probe.

## get started

two steps:

1. run [`/setup-pstack`](./skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md), pick a reasoning budget, and choose which models you want.
2. describe your task. the mode is already on.

`/poteto-mode` still works if you skipped the always-on step or want to name it
explicitly.

new here? the [pstack guide](./docs/guide/README.md) walks you through a first real task, from setup and prompting through verification and overnight runs.

that's it. the other skills are situational; the mode skill uses them for you as needed. out of the box the mode splits work by model strength: precisely-specified code goes to sol, fast mechanical code goes to grok, and prose and judgment go to gemini. the default panel is gemini / sol / grok / opus 5. [`/setup-pstack`](./skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md) changes any of it.

## usage

use [`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) at the start of a task. it reads your request, picks from a set of playbooks, and runs the other skills as the steps need them.

### just use [`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md)

this skill is the main shortcut. i use it whenever i need the agent to do rigorous engineering work. it comes with twenty-three playbooks:

```
/poteto-mode this pr has a subtle bug where the scroll drifts every 750ms even when idle. repro
first, then fix and verify.
```

```
/poteto-mode i'm going to bed. land the stack even if ci flakes. i want everything merged by
morning.
```

when invoked it:

1. matches your task to a [playbook](./skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/) and opens a todo list whose first items are its steps, copied in verbatim.
2. routes to the other skills as the steps fire.
3. writes unslopped replies framed for the consumer and the maintainer.

the full rules and playbooks live in [`skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md).

[`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) also holds across turns: once entered it stays on for the conversation, applying itself when a playbook matches or the task needs rigor and staying out of the way otherwise. copilot has no host-enforced mode flag, so the skill carries that contract itself. say "new task" to re-match, or say so plainly to opt out. want a session that starts in the mode and never leaves it? launch `copilot --agent poteto`.

[`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) works extremely well with copilot's autopilot mode. you can let the agent work for many hours without sacrificing rigor.

## skills

[`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) runs most of these for you when a step needs them (`how`, `why`, `architect`, `arena`, `swarm`, `interrogate`, `unslop`, `no-comments`, `technical-writing`, `tdd`, and the principles). the table below is for when you want one directly:

```
/how do we cancel runs? do we have an n+1 when we look up every run to cancel?
```

```
/interrogate review this pr.

## the `poteto-worker` and Comment Sicko subagents

pstack also ships a subagent that runs my style end to end. spawn it from a parent agent via [`agent_type: "poteto-worker"`](./agents/poteto-worker.agent.md). it reads `poteto-mode` in full, including its inline principles index, before doing any work. substituting `general-purpose` skips that read and drifts.

[`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) and [`agent_type: "poteto-worker"`](./agents/poteto-worker.agent.md) route through the same wrapper.

pstack also ships [Comment Sicko](./agents/comment-sicko.agent.md), a read-only comment reviewer available as `agent_type: "comment-sicko"`. usually invoke it through [`/no-comments`](./skills/no-comments/SKILL.md), not directly.

## principles

twenty-three short skills, one principle each. `poteto-mode` indexes them inline and reads that index at task start. the standalone files are there so other skills can reference a principle by name, and so the index can point at the full rule for each.

<details>
<summary>all twenty-three principles</summary>

| principle | group | rule |
|---|---|---|
| [laziness-protocol](./skills/principle-laziness-protocol/SKILL.md) | core | Bias toward deletion and the smallest change that solves the problem. |
| [foundational-thinking](./skills/principle-foundational-thinking/SKILL.md) | core | Apply before writing logic: choosing core types and data structures, sequencing scaffold-vs-feature work, asking what concurrent actors share. Get the data structures right so downstream code becomes obvious. |
| [redesign-from-first-principles](./skills/principle-redesign-from-first-principles/SKILL.md) | core | Redesign as if the requirement had been a foundational assumption from day one, instead of bolting it on. |
| [attack-the-premise](./skills/principle-attack-the-premise/SKILL.md) | core | Apply when two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate. Take a census of which actors hold the imbalance before the next fix, then question the premise instead of writing another fix that assumes it. |
| [subtract-before-you-add](./skills/principle-subtract-before-you-add/SKILL.md) | core | Remove dead weight, redundant validators, and stub references first, then build on the simpler base. |
| [minimize-reader-load](./skills/principle-minimize-reader-load/SKILL.md) | core | Count layers between question and answer, and hidden state in the reader's head; collapse one-caller wrappers and shrink mutable scope. |
| [outcome-oriented-execution](./skills/principle-outcome-oriented-execution/SKILL.md) | core | Apply during planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries. Converge on the target architecture; don't preserve smooth intermediate states with throwaway compatibility code. |
| [experience-first](./skills/principle-experience-first/SKILL.md) | core | Choose user delight over implementation convenience; ship fewer polished features over more rough ones. |
| [exhaust-the-design-space](./skills/principle-exhaust-the-design-space/SKILL.md) | core | Build 2-3 competing prototypes and compare side by side before committing. |
| [build-the-lever](./skills/principle-build-the-lever/SKILL.md) | core | Apply to any non-trivial work, not just bulk work: edits, migrations, analyses, checks. Build the tool that does it or proves it (codemod, script, generator, or a skill your subagents follow) instead of working by hand. The tool is the artifact a reviewer can rerun. |
| [model-the-domain](./skills/principle-model-the-domain/SKILL.md) | architecture | Encode the domain in a structure instead of scattered conditionals. |
| [boundary-discipline](./skills/principle-boundary-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Concentrate guards at system boundaries (CLI, config, network, external APIs); trust internal types and keep business logic in pure functions. |
| [type-system-discipline](./skills/principle-type-system-discipline/SKILL.md) | architecture | Make illegal states unrepresentable, brand semantic primitives, parse external data at boundaries, refuse to lie to the compiler, exhaust variants, derive from authoritative schemas. |
| [make-operations-idempotent](./skills/principle-make-operations-idempotent/SKILL.md) | architecture | Converge to the same end state regardless of partial prior runs. |
| [migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis](./skills/principle-migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis/SKILL.md) | architecture | Migrate callers and delete the old API in the same wave instead of preserving compatibility layers. |
| [separate-before-serializing-shared-state](./skills/principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state/SKILL.md) | architecture | Eliminate the sharing first; serialize structurally only when one shared writer is a real invariant. |
| [prove-it-works](./skills/principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply after completing a task, before declaring done. Verify against the real artifact (run the feature, read the actual value, inspect the diff), not a proxy, self-report, or 'it compiles.'. |
| [fix-root-causes](./skills/principle-fix-root-causes/SKILL.md) | verification | Trace each symptom to its root cause and fix it there; reproduce first, ask why until you reach it, resist nil-check guards that silence crashes. |
| [sequence-verifiable-units](./skills/principle-sequence-verifiable-units/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply to multi-step work (sweeps, migrations, runs of similar edits) and to how you stack commits and PRs. Break work into small units that each end in a verifiable state, check each before the next, and order delivery so the sequence proves itself to a reviewer. |
| [test-behavior-not-implementation](./skills/principle-test-behavior-not-implementation/SKILL.md) | verification | Apply when you write, change, or keep a test. Call the code the way its users do and assert the result they observe against a literal expected value. If the test would still pass when every imported function returns undefined, rewrite the assertion or delete the test. |
| [guard-the-context-window](./skills/principle-guard-the-context-window/SKILL.md) | delegation | Route bulk to subagents; keep summaries in the main thread, not raw payloads. |
| [never-block-on-the-human](./skills/principle-never-block-on-the-human/SKILL.md) | delegation | Proceed, present the result, let the human course-correct after the fact; reserve confirmation for irreversible actions. |
| [encode-lessons-in-structure](./skills/principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md) | meta | Encode the rule as a lint, metadata flag, runtime check, or script instead of more text. |

## not shipped here

a few things `poteto-mode` references but doesn't bundle:

this fork resolves the upstream plugin dependencies rather than pointing at them:

- `deslop` is the **Code** section of [`/unslop`](./skills/unslop/SKILL.md). there is no separate deslop skill; `deslop`, `deslop it`, and "clean the diff" all run that path.
- [`/create-skill`](./skills/create-skill/SKILL.md) is authored here, because copilot has no built-in equivalent.
- `/babysit` is the [babysit playbook](./skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/babysit.md), which is the only babysit in this fork.

still genuinely absent as bundled host tools: `control-cli` and `control-ui` from cursor-team-kit. playbooks do not depend on those names. they drive the project's `.github/skills/verify-*` skill, generate one with [`/create-verification-skill`](./skills/create-verification-skill/SKILL.md) when missing, or use the repo's own harness (Playwright, PTY, curl, the built binary). hand the operator the wheel only after stating why no harness can reach the target.

## why are there no planning skills?

copilot already has a great plan mode which works great with pstack. but personally, i don't believe in planning. the best spec is code. if you do want to make a plan, [`/poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) covers it, but it's not a default. 

## make it yours

`poteto-mode` is my style. you may not want exactly that.

type [`/automate-me`](./skills/automate-me/SKILL.md). it mines your recent transcripts, drafts a `<your-name>-mode` skill from how you've actually worked, and routes through pstack underneath. you keep pstack as the base and end up with your own routing skill alongside `poteto-mode`.

models are configurable too. type [`/setup-pstack`](./skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md). it detects the models you have access to and writes `~/.copilot/pstack-models.md`, a small override file mapping each role (code, judgment, the review panels) to a model. every skill that delegates opens it by path and falls back to sensible defaults when a line is absent, so you override only what you want.

a rerun keeps any role whose model differs from the default.

## automations

pstack also ships a dormant [benny workflow pack](./automations/benny/). benny triages incoming issue reports, then reproduces and fixes confirmed bugs with real ui evidence. its files are read by path and are not registered skills.

to set it up, point the agent at [`FOR_AGENTS.md`](./automations/benny/FOR_AGENTS.md). setup copies the pack into the target repository under `.github/automations/benny/` and keeps user configuration outside the copied pack. no per-repo registration is needed, since pstack is registered globally. the two automations run as scheduled copilot workflows created with `save_workflow`, and the intake defaults to azure devops work items.

## always-on

upstream cursor makes the mode sticky with `mode: true` in the skill frontmatter.
copilot ignores that key, so the port carries the same behaviour a different way.

```bash
node scripts/install-always-on.mjs
```

the installer does three user-scoped writes:

1. a managed block in `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md`. copilot loads that
   file into the **system prompt** of every session, in every directory, git or
   not. the block is a short router. it names when the mode applies and tells
   the agent to invoke the [`poteto-mode`](./skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md) skill
   by name, so a trivial question doesn't drag two hundred lines of playbook
   into context. invoking by name matters: a block that pointed at an absolute
   path under `~/.copilot` would be denied the read, while the skill tool loads
   the same file with no permission at all.
2. `~/.copilot` in `config.json` `trustedFolders`, so the host treats that tree
   as trusted without wiping folders you already listed.
3. a `pstack` CLI wrapper (`~/.copilot/bin/*` plus a marked profile/rc block)
   that runs `copilot --add-dir ~/.copilot ...`. playbooks, references, and
   `pstack-models.md` are normal disk reads. without that grant, non-interactive
   sessions fail the read and used to invent upstream behavior from memory. the
   mode skill now **stops** on a denied playbook read instead.

three properties worth knowing:

- it is user-scoped, so a fresh `git clone` you open tomorrow already has it.
- the always-on block rides in the system prompt, which is re-sent with every
  model request, so a long autopilot run cannot lose the mode to context
  compaction.
- it is idempotent, and each write only touches its own markers or the
  `~/.copilot` trust entry. anything else you keep survives.

`--dry-run` shows the change without writing. `--uninstall` reverses all three.
`--skip-shell` keeps always-on and trustedFolders only. `skip poteto mode`
stands the mode down for a session without editing anything.

the always-on source text lives at
[`always-on/copilot-instructions.md`](./always-on/copilot-instructions.md).
edit that and re-run the installer to change what every session sees. a session
assembles its system prompt at startup, so an edit reaches new sessions, not
ones already running.

## checking the port

```bash
node scripts/check-copilot-port.mjs
```

one zero-dependency script guards the things that silently break a copilot skill. it fails when a `name` doesn't match its folder (the skill then registers under the wrong slash command), when a `description` is missing or past copilot's 1024-character load limit, when frontmatter carries a key copilot ignores, when a relative link in the docs or skills doesn't resolve, and when prose still names a tool from another agent runtime. repo-local skills under `.github/skills/` get the name, frontmatter, and link checks but skip the foreign-token check, since they name other runtimes' tools on purpose.

there is no CI gate. this org disables hosted runners and the repo has no self-hosted ones, so a workflow here would fail on every PR without ever running the script. enforcement lives in the authoring path instead. the **create-skill** procedure and the **authoring-a-skill** playbook both name this command as a required step, which is the path an agent actually takes through this repo. run it yourself before you open a PR.

## syncing upstream

run the repo-local [`/sync-upstream`](./.github/skills/sync-upstream/SKILL.md) skill from this repo. it subtree-merges `pstack/` from `cursor/plugins` main, reapplies the port rules to upstream's changes, runs the checker and a review, and opens the PR. merge the PR with a merge commit, not a squash, so the next sync starts from the right upstream point.

| `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, `/add-plugin` | a `skillDirectories` entry in `~/.copilot/settings.json` |
| project-scoped plugin install | global; every repo you open gets the skills |
| `mode: true` sticky frontmatter | a managed block in `~/.copilot/copilot-instructions.md`, plus `trustedFolders` and a `pstack --add-dir` wrapper, installed by [`install-always-on.mjs`](./scripts/install-always-on.mjs) |
| `AGENTS.md` subagent contract | `.agent.md` files spawned through the `task` tool |
| `AskQuestion` tool | the `ask_user` tool |
| one model slug per role | `model` plus `reasoning_effort`, two fields |
| `claude-fable-5` panel seat | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` |
| graphite (`gt`) stacking | azure devops PR chains driven by `az repos` |
| github PR review threads | ado threads via the ado mcp |
| event-triggered automations | scheduled copilot workflows via `save_workflow` |
| slack intake for benny | intake adapter, defaults to ado work items |
| separate `deslop` skill | Code path inside [`/unslop`](./skills/unslop/SKILL.md) |
| bundled `create-skill` | authored here; copilot ships no equivalent |
| `make-bot-ui` (cursor grok bot webhooks) | dropped; copilot has no equivalent |
| `control-cli` / `control-ui` | project `verify-*` skills + [`/create-verification-skill`](./skills/create-verification-skill/SKILL.md) |

`control-cli` and `control-ui` are not bundled. verification goes through a
project verify skill or a generated one, not an operator-drive default.
