# Setup pstack

Write `~/.copilot/pstack-models.md`, a personal override file that sets pstack's model and reasoning effort per role. The skills read it and fall back to `models.default.md` in the pstack fork when a line is absent, so this is an override layer, not a requirement.

Copilot has no user-global always-applied rule, so this file is not auto-injected. Every pstack skill that delegates opens it explicitly as its first step. That is the contract: this skill writes it, the skills read it.

The file lives outside the pstack fork on purpose, so `git pull` from upstream never conflicts with your choices.

## Steps

### 1. Detect available models

Read the `model` and `reasoning_effort` parameter documentation on the `task` tool in this session. It lists every model ID you can pass and the effort values each one supports. That is the dependable source. Never write a model ID or effort value you have not confirmed is listed there. `inherit-parent` and `auto` are always valid even though they are not real IDs.

A model choice is two fields in Copilot, `model` and `reasoning_effort`. Record both per role.

### 2. Load current state

Read `<pstack>/models.default.md` for the defaults. If `~/.copilot/pstack-models.md` already exists, read it and treat its `# budget` line and role values as the current choices. A line whose role is not in `models.default.md` is from a retired role. Drop it.

### 3. Budget, map, and confirm

**(a) Ask for a budget.** Prefer the `ask_user` tool over free text. Offer these four options with these exact labels, and name the current budget when the file records one.

- `unlimited — keep max`
- `large — xhigh reasoning`
- `medium — high reasoning`
- `small — medium reasoning`

**(b) Apply it.** Build the working table from `models.default.md`, and on a re-run keep any role the user changed by model family, list length, or alias (`inherit-parent`, `auto`). `unlimited`, `large`, `medium`, and `small` set the `reasoning_effort` of every real model, panel entries included, to `max`, `xhigh`, `high`, or `medium`. Cap the effort at each model's maximum from the detected documentation; `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` maxes at `high`. If a model has no supported effort at or below the target, mark the role as needing a choice. `inherit-parent` and `auto` do not change.

**(c) Show the roles and confirm.** Show every role with its model and effort, marking any real model or effort not in the detected set as needing a choice. Also list each line step 2 dropped. Ask whether to accept as-is or change specific roles, offering the detected models plus `inherit-parent` and `auto`. Prefer the `ask_user` tool with choices over free text. For panel roles (arena runners, architect runners, interrogate reviewers) the value is a list, and one subagent runs per entry, alias entries included, so the list length sets the count. `arena cross-judge pool` is also a list, but Arena selects one value from it whose model family differs from the parent's when possible. `swarm workers` is the default model for every worker unless a race or comparison assigns another model per arm.

Keep vendor diversity in the panel roles. The second-opinion rule depends on it, and four checkpoints from one vendor is not a panel.

### 4. Validate

Every real model ID written must be in the detected set, and every effort value must be one the model actually supports. `inherit-parent` and `auto` always pass. If a chosen pair is unavailable, stop and ask again. A config pointing at a model the user cannot use breaks every delegation that reads it.

### 5. Write the override file

Write `~/.copilot/pstack-models.md`, a `# budget` line with the chosen label and target effort, and one line per role, using the same labels `models.default.md` uses and the same `model / effort` shape. Overwrite the whole file so re-runs stay idempotent. Shape:

```
# pstack model configuration. One line per role.
# Delete a line to fall back to models.default.md in the pstack fork.
# `inherit-parent` or `auto`: the role runs on the parent chat model. Omit `model` and
# `reasoning_effort` on the task call. Alias entries in a panel list still count toward fan-out.

### 6. Confirm

Tell the user the file was written and that skills pick it up on their next run, no restart needed. Re-running this skill updates it.

### 7. Offer a verification skill (optional)

Check whether the project has a way to drive the real app for proof (a `verify-*` skill, or an existing harness). If not, offer once: "want a project-local verification skill, so agents can drive the app the way a user does and prove changes work? I can generate one with the create-verification-skill skill." On yes, invoke it. On no, move on without pushing.
